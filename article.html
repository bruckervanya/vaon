        <p class="col-7 margin--top--spacing-06">This topic is an ancient one in the deliberations of economists, going back many centuries. However, there was a hiatus for about twenty years, from about 1935 to about 1955, when there was very little
          discussion or work in
          this area.
          As you all know, the unduly high hopes which were placed in the Reserve System in the 1920s as a means of promoting a permanent new era and a high level of stability were disappointed by the Great Depression of 1929 to 1933.
          The profession of economics as a whole then shifted very radically from one course to another. From a general belief that the stock of money and the changes in it are tremendously important in controlling economic affairs, the profession
          shifted toward the view that money has little importance and does not matter except in rather trivial ways. It shifted toward the belief that the important things to look at are the flows of investment expenditures, on the one hand, and
          consumer expenditures, on the other. It was said that if these are taken into account, it really does not make much difference what happens to the stock of money.</p>
        <h2 class="col-7 expressive-heading-04 margin--top--spacing-06">Historical Background</h2>
        <p class="col-7 margin--top--spacing-05">This problem goes back to the Revolutionary War when, as all governments do in time of war and in time of need, we resorted to the printing press. As you know, the phrase “not worth a Continental”
          arose out of the Continental
          currency which was issued during the Revolutionary War and which came to be regarded as worthless. I should make clear that there is such a thing as progress in human affairs. The degree of inflation in the Revolutionary War was very
          modest, measured by modern standards. It was nothing like the German hyperinflation, or the hyperinflation in Hungary after World War II. It was of a much more moderate order of magnitude — prices increased only several thousand-fold — but
          this did start us off on the idea that there is some problem about money.</p>-->
